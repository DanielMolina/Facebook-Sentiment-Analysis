The project involves constructing a computational model that is used to examine nicotine addiction and to build simple machine learning classifiers to make inferences about addiction from tobacco relevant posts. The main goal of this project is to gain a greater understanding of the mechanisms of nicotine addiction and of Facebook as tool for addiction treatment and public health surveillance.
